	<p>There is much variation between breeds, from size to color to behavior; one breed is even known for its fainting tendencies. Some have perky ears while others' are floppy. Some are large, others pygmy.</p>

					<li>Long, floppy ears and a concave "Roman nose" snout make Nubian goats distinctive. This breed of dairy goats can survive in hotter climes than other dairy goats because of their Middle Eastern ancestry, and they have a longer breeding season. Nubian goats produce less milk per goat than other breeds, but their milk has a very high fat content. Alternatively, this breed is raised for both meat and dairy.</li>

				<li>This diminutive dairy breed is really charismatic! With only about 2 feet tall and 75 pounds, they are smaller than larger breeds. Even breeding bucks can be handled with ease because this breed is kind and friendly. They have a reputation for making excellent companions and ideal 4-H or FFA animal projects for young children.</li>

					<li>This meat goat from New Zealand develops quickly to market weight, is simple to manage, and will even clear weeds from your property. In the 1980s, New Zealanders crossed dairy goats with strays to create the Kiko goat. Growth rate and survival were the objectives. When breeders began mating Kikos with Boer goats to combine meat output with mothering prowess, the breed gained off in the U.S. around 2000.</li>

				<li>This dairy breed, which has its roots in the French Alps, can survive in almost any environment. The best goats can produce up to two gallons of milk each day, making them the highest milk producers. These goats must have their meals carefully controlled because of the large amount of milk they produce. This breed is quiet and inquisitive, and it gets along well with people, according to PJ Jonas, who raises Alpines to provide milk for her family of ten and runs a goat product company.</li>
